An open source implementation of Spotify Car Thing

## What is this?

This is an open source implementation in react native of the Spotify Car Thing
product. It's not limited to be used in cars though, and can literally run on
any mobile phone. It uses the [Spotify Web
API](http://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).

## How can I try this?

This project isn't yet published anywhere, so the only way to try it is to run it locally. To get this up and running, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone repository

    git clone https://github.com/albingroen/thing.git
    
### 2. Install dependencies

    yarn install
    
Or if you'd rather use npm

    npm install
    
### 3. Run the project

    yarn start
    
And then choose which platform to use. I've done most of the development on a iOS device, so that's probably going to work best.
