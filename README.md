An open source implementation of Spotify Car Thing

## What is this?

This is an open source implementation in react native of the Spotify Car Thing
product. It's not limited to be used in cars though, and can literally run on
any mobile phone. It uses the [Spotify Web
API](http://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
